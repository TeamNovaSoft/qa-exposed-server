#  Scope of the project and the specific features that will be implemented

The GitHub Repo Manager is a web application that allows users to manage their GitHub repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of a repository, such as branches, tags, and releases. The app also includes features like action running, which allows users to run scripts or commands on the repository, authentication and authorization, which ensures that only authorized users can access the repository, responsive design, which makes the app easy to use on different devices, accessibility, which ensures that the app is accessible to users with disabilities, error handling, which helps to identify and resolve any errors that may occur during the usage of the app, testing, which allows developers to test their code before deploying it to production, and deployment, which allows developers to easily deploy their code to a production environment.

The GitHub Repo Manager is designed to be easy to use and provides a range of features that make it an effective tool for managing GitHub repositories. It is available as a web application and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

## Scope
  The scope of the project is to create a web-based application that allows users to manage their GitHub repositories. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of a repository, such as branches, tags, and releases.

## Features

The features of the application are:

1. User authentication and authorization: The app should allow only authorized users to access the repository.
2. Branch switching: Users should be able to switch between different branches in the repository.
3. Action running: Users should be able to run scripts or commands on the repository.
4. Responsive design: The app should be easy to use and accessible on different devices.
5. Accessibility: The app should be accessible to users with disabilities.
6. Error handling: The app should be able to identify and resolve any errors that may occur during usage.
7. Testing: The app should allow developers to test their code before deploying it to production.
8. Deployment: The app should allow developers to easily deploy their code to a production environment.

The application should be designed with a user-friendly interface and should provide a range of features that make it an effective tool for managing GitHub repositories.

## Users


Developers:

- Developers can use the tool to manage their code changes and collaborate with other team members.
- They can create a new branch for each feature or bug fix they are working on, and then push their changes to that branch.
- They can also switch between different branches to see how their changes affect the codebase.
- Developers can use the tool to run automated tests and check if their changes have broken any existing functionality.
- If there are any issues found during testing, developers can use the tool to report them back to QA for further investigation.
- Once a feature or bug fix is complete, developers can merge their branch into the main branch using the tool.

QA:

- QA can use the tool to review changes made by developers and ensure that they meet the requirements of the product.
- They can follow instructions left by developers to check if the branch has the required changes for a certain ticket or found any bugs and report them back to developers.
- QA can also use the tool to run automated tests on the codebase to identify any issues before it is released to customers.
- If there are any issues found during testing, QA can use the tool to report them back to developers for further investigation.

Product Managers:

- Product managers can use the tool to review changes made by developers and ensure that they meet the requirements of the product.
- They can also use the tool to see the results of the latest work on certain branches or in the main branch, which can help them make informed decisions about the direction of the product.
- Product managers can use the tool to review the codebase and identify any issues or areas for improvement.
- If there are any issues found during testing, product managers can use the tool to report them back to developers for further investigation.

Overall, this tool would provide a streamlined way for developers, QA, and product managers to collaborate on code changes, review changes made by others, and ensure that the codebase meets the requirements of the product.
