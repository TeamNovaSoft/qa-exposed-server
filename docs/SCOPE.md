- Real-time Progress Monitoring: Gain real-time insights into the latest work on specific branches or the main branch, enabling informed decision-making regarding product direction.
- Progress Tracking and Resolution: Collaborate with developers to address any issues identified during testing, ensuring timely resolution and product quality.
- QA Support: Product managers can also contribute to QA efforts by performing smoke tests, verifying requirements, and assisting in testing activities when needed. Additionally, they can review the frontend preview to ensure features align with expectations or report any issues independently.


## Out of Scope Items

- Direct integration with GitHub: EasyEnvPreview should not directly integrate with GitHub's API. Instead, it should use a separate API layer to communicate with GitHub. This will make the application more flexible and easier to test.
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD): EasyEnvPreview should not include built-in CI/CD functionality. This can be handled by separate tools like Jenkins or Travis CI.
- Full-blown code editor: EasyEnvPreview should not include a fully functional code editor.
- Issue tracking and bug reporting: EasyEnvPreview should not include a built-in issue tracking system. This can be handled by separate tools like GitHub Issues or Jira.
- Real-time collaboration features: EasyEnvPreview should not include real-time collaboration features like live editing or code sharing.
- Third-party integrations: EasyEnvPreview should initially focus on its core functionalities and should not include integrations with third-party services.
- Customizable themes and layouts: EasyEnvPreview should initially have a fixed theme and layout. Customizable themes and layouts can be added in a future release.
- This project doesn't have access or manage keys, passwords or anything related to security, if this is not configured properly the project just error, and the user solves that issues.
