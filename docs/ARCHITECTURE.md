â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ logging
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

The system architecture, designed for scalability and fault tolerance, leverages a monorepo structure. Docker is utilized for containerization, and customization is facilitated through configuration files to adapt to different projects. Git manages version control, while GitHub Actions handle testing and linting. Logging is centralized, producing logs in local files.

The system components include:

- Frontend Service
- Server Service
- Monitoring and Analytics Service
- Logging Service

Each component can be independently deployed and scaled as needed, ensuring optimal performance and reliability for handling varying volumes of traffic and data within the monorepo architecture.

#### Components

The following is an overview of each component in the system:

##### Frontend Service

The frontend service handles incoming requests from users and directs them to the appropriate backend service. Additionally, it manages user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.

##### Server Service

The server service is responsible for processing requests from the frontend service and performing actions such as data retrieval, calculation, and storage. It also provides endpoints for the frontend service to communicate with.

##### Logging Service

The logging service is responsible for logging all activity in the system, including user interactions, system events, and error messages. This allows for easy debugging and troubleshooting of issues.

By organizing the components in this way, you can easily manage and maintain the system by focusing on specific areas of the application. For example, if you need to make changes to the authentication service, you can do so without having to worry about other parts of the application.

### Diagrams of the system's components and their interactions

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Frontend] -->|Requests| B[Server]
    B -->|Errors| C[Logging]
    A -->|Search for Log| C
```

This flow diagram shows the interactions between the different components of the system. The frontend component receives incoming requests from users and sends them to the server service for processing. The server service performs actions such as data retrieval, calculation, and storage, and then sends the results back to the frontend component for display to the user. The monitoring and analytics service is responsible for monitoring the system's performance and health, providing alerts and notifications when there are issues or errors. Finally, the logging service is responsible for logging all activity in the system, including user interactions, system events, and error messages.

4. SelectRepo: If the user selects a repo and clicks the button, an action to change branch is triggered via a command call to the shell.
5. ChangeBranch: If the action fails, an error is shown and stored in a log.
6. RunAction: If the user decides to run the action of the repo, it's a command call to the shell.
7. ShowResult: If the action succeeds, the result is shown on the client.
8. End: The process ends.

## III. User Interface

### Description of the user interface and its features

- Search bar: A search bar that allows users to quickly find specific content within the application. This could be a text input field with a magnifying glass icon next to it, and when the user types in a query, the application should perform a search and display the results. The search results could be displayed as a list of cards or a grid of thumbnails, depending on the type of content being searched.
- Content cards: Cards that display information about each repository, including its name, description, and other relevant details. These cards should be visually appealing and easy to read, with clear headings and concise text. The cards could also include additional information such as the number of stars, forks, and contributors, as well as a link to the repository's homepage or documentation.
- Pagination: A pagination system that allows users to navigate through large datasets of repositories in a more manageable way. This could be done by displaying a series of buttons at the bottom of the page, each one representing a different page of results. When a user clicks on a button, the application should display the corresponding set of results.
- Notifications: A notification system that alerts users when new content is available, or when they receive a message from another user. This could be done by displaying a small icon in the top right corner of the page, such as a bell or an envelope. When the user clicks on the icon, a dropdown menu should appear with any unread notifications.
- Dark mode: The ability to toggle between light and dark modes for better readability and customization. This could be done by adding a button in the top right corner of the page that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. When the user enables dark mode, the application should use a dark background color and light text, and vice versa.
- Accessibility features: Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing features such as screen reader support, high contrast mode, and keyboard navigation. This could be done by adding a button in the top right corner of the page that allows users to toggle accessibility settings. When the user enables accessibility settings, the application should use a different color scheme, font size, and layout to make it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and read the content.

### Screenshots or diagrams of the user interface



### Information about the user experience and how it will be designed to meet the needs of the target audience

  User Experience (UX) is a critical aspect of any product, including software applications. It refers to the way in which users interact with a system, and the overall experience they have while using it. In the context of this project, we will be designing an application that allows users to create and manage their own personalized playlists based on their music preferences.

In terms of functionality, we will focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create and manage their playlists. We will also prioritize data privacy and security, ensuring that our application does not collect or store any personal information without the user's consent.

Overall, our goal is to create a user experience that is both intuitive and enjoyable, while also meeting the needs of our target audience. By focusing on usability, accessibility, design, and functionality, we can ensure that our application is a success in the marketplace.

## IV. Security and Privacy

### Overview of the security measures in place, such as authentication and authorization
   
The security and privacy of our application are of utmost importance. To ensure that sensitive data is protected, we have implemented the following measures:

Authentication and Authorization: We use basic authentication with a username and password to secure access to our application. This ensures that only authorized users can access the application and perform actions on behalf of the user.
Internal Communication: All communication between the server and the backend is internal to the server, and not exposed to the outside world. This means that any sensitive data or credentials are not transmitted over the internet.
Key Management: We do not store any keys in any form, and we take appropriate measures to ensure that they are not compromised.
Logging: We use logging to track all activity on our application, but we have implemented measures to prevent critical information from being exposed in the logs.

Overall, our security and privacy measures are designed to protect sensitive data and ensure that our application is secure and reliable.

### Description of how data is encrypted and stored

The data is not encrypted or stored in a database. Instead, it is stored in session storage, which is a temporary area of memory that holds data for a specific user session. The basic authentication credentials (username and password) are stored in this session storage.

The only public endpoint that serves static assets is the one that handles the login process. All other endpoints are not exposed to the outside world, so they do not need to be protected with encryption or access control mechanisms.

Logs are not saving sensitive information, as they only contain non-sensitive data such as error messages and system events.

To protect against data breaches, we have implemented a robust incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to security incidents, including data breaches. We also regularly perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address any weaknesses in our systems.

Overall, our approach to data encryption and storage is designed to provide a high level of security and privacy for our users' data, while also ensuring that the application is highly available and scalable.

### Information about how the system will comply with relevant privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA

To ensure that our system complies with relevant privacy regulations, we will take the following steps:

1. Implement data minimization principles: We will only collect and store the minimum amount of personal data necessary to provide the service.
2. Provide transparent information about data collection and use: We will be transparent about how we collect, use, and share personal data, and provide users with control over their data through features such as data deletion and privacy settings.
3. Use secure data storage practices: We will ensure that all personal data is stored in a secure manner, using encryption and other security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure.
4. Comply with applicable laws and regulations: We will comply with all relevant privacy laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and ensure that our data protection practices are in line with these requirements.
5. Provide users with access to their personal data: We will provide users with access to their personal data, allowing them to view, correct, or delete it as needed.
6. Implement data protection by design and by default: We will implement data protection principles into our development process, including data minimization, data protection by design, and data protection by default.
7. Provide users with control over their data: We will provide users with control over their personal data, allowing them to make decisions about how it is collected, used, and shared.
8. Continuously monitor and evaluate our privacy practices: We will continuously monitor and evaluate our privacy practices, making sure that they are compliant with relevant laws and regulations, and taking steps to improve our data protection practices as needed.

By implementing these measures, we can ensure that our system is in compliance with relevant privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, and protect the personal information of our users.
