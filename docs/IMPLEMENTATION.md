The frontend of the application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will use a configuration file in TOML to store settings and credentials.

The backend of the application will be built using Rust and Axum. We will use the Axum framework to handle HTTP requests and responses, and we will use the Diesel ORM to interact with our database.

We will not be using a database for this project. Instead, we will store data in memory using the HashMap data structure from the Rust standard library.

The application will have no user information, so there will be no need to implement any authentication or authorization features.

I would like you to help me with the following tasks:

    Implementing the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    Creating a configuration file in TOML for storing settings and credentials
    Writing the backend code using Rust and Axum
    Implementing the database logic using Diesel ORM
    Testing the application to ensure it is working correctly

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this project.
